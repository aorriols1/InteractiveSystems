Some of the modifications and new functionalities added to my project are listed in this file, which where done using the part2 of the exercise.
These additions were made for polishing the game and the overall gaming experience. 

First, I added some visual effects by creating a small heart model that flies up from any saved sheep. 

Then, I also added some sound effects by playing some audio clips.
These audios are associated with the shooting of the Hay Machine, hitting a sheep or played when a sheep is dropped.

Moreover, in order to keep track of the score of the game, that is, knowing how many sheeps we saved and how many we dropped, I made some modifications.
This modifications imply manipulating the Gamne UI (User Interface) as well as using the triggers to count the game score.
However, I was not able to keep track of the dropped sheeps and instead of counting one dropped sheep as 1, my game counts it as 2.
I have searched for this problem and maybe I am calling the Drop() method more than once in some script, but I could not locate it.

Then, I modified the visualization of the title screen buttons, that make more clear for the player which button is selected.

Finally, I implemented the option of changing the color of the hay machine from the title screen by clicking on the hay machine located in the Title.
This is related with the ability of passing data between two scenes as the Title and the Game.
